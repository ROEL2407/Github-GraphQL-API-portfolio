## Description 
A portfolio website built with the GitHub GraphQL. You can see all GitHub projects of a person and see more details about it.

## Features
This is app is a portfolio site where you can see all your GitHub repositories. You see your repository with a description on the homepage and the languages the code consists of. You have two buttons, one for the live demo and one to go to a detail page. On the detail page, you can read the README of that project. 

## Paid attention
While building this project, we paid extra attention that the site would be supported on all devices. We did this by adding support tags in our code. 

Example 
```css
@supports(display:flex) {
    header {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        justify-content: space-between;
        align-items: center;
        padding: 1em 4em;
    }
```

## Commits
In this repo we will commit our work. To make this more visible for ourselves and others, we've added little headers to the commit titles:
* Created = a file is created
* Updated = updated a file or piece of code
* Delete = deleted a file

## Resources

### Credits

* Stack Overflow for giving us the answers that we could tweak or that helped us understand our problem in the code better.
